On Monday May 4 and Tuesday 5 May, this web-based conferencing application was used on Læringsfestivalen 2015 for testing and evaluation. In this context, we invited the conference participants to join in s survey.
In recent times we have invited people who were not at the conference, but has conference experience in the college and university sector to take a very similar, but still separate survey.
It is important for our thesis that we keep the responses from these surveys separated from each other!
